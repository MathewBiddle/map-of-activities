Santa Barbara Channel Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON),"<p>The Southern California Bight Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (SCB MBON) is designed to provide a complete picture of marine biodiversity in the region. SCB MBON is developing a widely applicable research model that integrates new information with existing data to improve current research and monitoring programs and provide greater insight into marine biodiversity.</p>
<p>Millions of dollars are spent annually monitoring marine resources, however, such efforts are uncoordinated and have major information gaps. We are developing a scalable and reproducible Marine Biodiversity Observation Network using the Southern California Bight as a case study. This network will connect existing marine monitoring efforts in the Southern California Bight and work to fill information gaps.</p>
<p>Focusing on the Southern California Bight allows our researchers to explore marine biodiversity from whole marine ecosystem level all the way to the smallest microbe communities. The ability to study such a range of biodiversity is due to the extensive amount of existing biological monitoring and research programs conducted by our partners. Yet even with the extensive research being conducted in the Southern California Bight, there are still information gaps. To fill these gaps, SCB MBON is testing novel methods for monitoring biodiversity, including automated image analysis and genomics.</p>",https://geonode.goosocean.org/layers/geonode_data:geonode:santa_barbara_channel_marine_diversity_observation_network,geonode:santa_barbara_channel_marine_diversity_observation_network,480

Southeast US Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (SE US MBON),"<p>The Southeast US Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (SE US MBON) effort is structured to assess ecosystem integrity, advance protection of marine resources, and promote conservation. Specifically, we focus on the integration of ground and satellite observations related to biodiversity to inform ecosystem-based management in and around the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS). This includes supporting the regional NOAA Integrated Ecosystem Assessment, the NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center, the FKNMS, the Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, and the State of Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) as specific end users of the SE US MBON. The project is led by the College of Marine Science, University of South Florida, in close partnership with NOAA Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Lab, the FKNMS, the US Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS; specifically GCOOS and SECOORA), the FWC Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, the University of Miami, and the Oregon State University. The project has carried out oceanographic surveys of the Florida Keys since 2014 every two months, circumnavigating the FKNMS and south Florida. The project has also contributed to the development of the satellite-derived seascapes served through NOAA CoastWatch, data formatting standards with the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS), and the biology and ecosystems Essential Ocean Variables (EOV/GOOS) and Essential Climate Variables (ECV/GCOS). <a href=""https://marinebon.github.io/pages/sfmbon/"">https://marinebon.github.io/pages/sfmbon/</a></p>",https://geonode.goosocean.org/layers/geonode_data:geonode:mbon_florida_cruises,geonode:mbon_florida_cruises,846

European ARMS program,"<p>The European ARMS programme (ARMS-MBON) is a network of Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) placed in the vicinity of marine stations, ports, marinas, and Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites distributed over Europe and polar regions. The aim of ARMS-MBON is to assess the status of, and changes in, hard-bottom communities of near-coast environments, using genetic methods supplemented with image analysis and visual inspection methods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ARMS-MBON is part of GEO BONs<a href=""https://marinebon.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""> Marine Biodiversity Observation Network</a> (MBON) as well as the European Marine Omics Biodiversity Observation Network CALLED EMO BON (https://www.embrc.eu/emo-bon).</p>
<p>ARMS units are passive monitoring systems originally developed during the <a href=""https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/marine-census.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Census of Marine Life</a> project for the collection of marine fauna on and near the sea floor. Similarly to settlement plates, the ARMS units are stacks of plates that mimic the complex structure of the sea bottom. They are deployed on marine substrates and colonised by marine species, and after a period of time they are recovered by a team and taken apart to see who moved in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of our scientific goals is to identify newly arrived Non-Indigenous Species (NIS), facilitating an early warning system, and to track the migration of already known NIS in European continental waters. The data collected by the ARMS-MBON programme has the potential to be used for calculating Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) on the distribution and abundance of benthic and non-indigenous species, as well as for continental-scale research on the community ecology and biogeography of benthic invertebrates.regio</p>",https://geonode.goosocean.org/layers/geonode_data:geonode:european_arms_program,geonode:european_arms_program,98
